Based On: [React + Redux - User Registration and Login Tutorial & Example](http://jasonwatmore.com/post/2017/09/16/react-redux-user-registration-and-login-tutorial-example)

## Authentication
Mesi contains user authentication implementation with "Admin" and "User" roles.
Admin - for a team leader and User - for  programmer.

Team leader can create tasks and drag them to programmer earea - to assign the task to the programmer.
Programmers can notify their progress by changing the status of the task (by clicking on status label):

* `new`
* `active` - the task programmer is currently working on (will appear blue at Admin's dashboard)
* `completed`

## Stack

* Backend: [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
* Awesome [AngularJS](http://www.angularjs.org/) on the client
